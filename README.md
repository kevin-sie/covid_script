# covid_script

As a requirement for being on-campus, I have to get 2 weekly COVID tests. As a way to automate the task and have one less thing to worry about, I created this script. 

This script will login and reserve the appointments without needing my interaction. Considering that I want an appointment at the same date and time, I use variables to target the respective dates.

I did not have previous experience with Python and using API's so I spent most of the time learning about syntax and how to use them.
